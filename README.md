__Hex__ is a board game originally by [Piet Hein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piet_Hein_(scientist)#Work) and popularized by [John Nash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Forbes_Nash,_Jr.).
The goal of the game is to connect your sides of the board.
<span style="color:#E52D3D;">red</span> connects the left and right of the board whilst
<span style="color:#655DE2;">blue</span> connects the top and bottom of the board.
You take turns to choose a hex to take. In ___HEX___ though, you program an AI in [Javascript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) to choose your hex's for you.
