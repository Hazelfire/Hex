# Hex
__Hex__ is a board game originally by [Piet Hein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piet_Hein_(scientist)#Work) and popularized by [John Nash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Forbes_Nash,_Jr.).
The goal of the game is to connect your sides of the board.<br>
red connects the left and right of the board whilst<br>
blue connects the top and bottom of the board.
You take turns to choose a hex to take. In ___HEX___ though, you program an AI in [Javascript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) to choose your hex's for you.
